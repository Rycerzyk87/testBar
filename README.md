# testBar
How it's works?

I create this widget the easiest way's possible.
I create class Bar to operate js script with new object(about it later).
In simple JavaScript I get html elements to variables, after that i create events on buttons.

How to use?

Add this script to html after any others js files:

<script type="text/javascript">
        let myBar = new Bar({
            message: 'Add beautiful widgets to your website',
            position: 'top',
        });
</script>

Thank's for your attention. :)
